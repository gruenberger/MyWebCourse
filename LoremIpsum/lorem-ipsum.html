            <p>The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of
                evil men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley
                of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike
                down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to poison and destroy My
                brothers. And you will know My name is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon thee.</p>

                Antwone into a glass motherfuckin' house, fuckin' up the way the guy talks. Motherfucker do that shit
                to me, he better paralyze my ass, 'cause I'll kill the motherfucker, know what I'm sayin'?</p>

            <p>Now that we know who you are, I know who I am. I'm not a mistake! It all makes sense! In a comic, you
                know how you can tell who the arch-villain's going to be? He's the exact opposite of the hero. And most
                times they're friends, like you and me! I should've known way back when... You know why, David? Because
                of the kids. They called me Mr Glass.</p>

                Lorem Ipsum is unattractive, both inside and out. I fully understand why it’s former users left it for
                something else. They made a good decision.
            </p>

            <p class="two">
                He’s not a word hero. He’s a word hero because he was captured. I like text that wasn’t captured. Lorem
                Ipsum's father was with Lee Harvey Oswald prior to Oswald's being, you know, shot. Look at that text!
                Would
                anyone use that? Can you imagine that, the text of your next webpage?! Lorem Ipsum best not make any

                We have so many things that we have to do better... and certainly ipsum is one of them. He’s not a word
                hero. He’s a word hero because he was captured. I like text that wasn’t captured.
